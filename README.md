# Indicators in Pine Script

1. [Confirm signals | RSI + MFI](RSI+MFI/README.md)<br>
    Confirm whether a signal is TRUE or FALSE by comparing price (RSI) with volume (MFI).
   
3. [RSI - Divergences Indicator](RSI+MFI/RSITMA.md)<br>
    Combined momentum indicator displaying RSI, MFI (Money Flow Index), TMA (Triangular Moving Average), and automatic divergence detection.

4. [EMA Crossovers Strategy](CROSSOVER-EMAs/README.md)<br>
    This strategy automatically buys and sells based on the crossover of two lines: a fast EMA (9 periods) and a slow EMA (21 periods).

5. [Bollinger Bands & EMA Crossovers](BOLLINGER-BANDS/README.md)<br>
    This indicator combines two technical analysis tools: EMAs to identify trends and Bollinger Bands to measure volatility and overbought/oversold levels.

6. [OBV & Bollinger Bands](OBV+BOLLINGER-BANDS/README.md)<br>
  This indicator analyzes trading volume to confirm the strength of price trends. It combines OBV (On Balance Volume) with Bollinger Bands and a fast EMA.

7. [MACD Impulse](MACD-IMPULSE/README.md)<br>
    This indicator measures the strength of price momentum in a smoother and less noisy way than traditional MACD. It uses special moving averages to filter out market noise.

8. [Order Flow Bubbles](DEEP-CHART/README.md)<br>
    Deep Chart is an indicator I designed to show you the hidden "tug-of-war" inside every single candle. I created this by utilizing TradingView's ability to peak inside a bar to see the tiny trades that normally stay hidden. I have included a system of colorful "Bubbles" to mark exactly where the big, aggressive trades happened. I developed this by utilizing internal scanning logic to find the exact price levels of high activity. The result is a clear map I built to show market "hot spots" without the need to switch between different charts or timeframes.

9. [Market Profile — Performance and Stability Fixes](MARKET-PROFILE/README.md)<br>
    Optimized Market Profile indicator with major performance improvements, faster Volume Profile POC calculation, and fixes for Pine Script v5 runtime errors, index safety, and ticker handling.
