# Indicators in Pine Script

1. [Confirm signals | RSI + MFI](RSI+MFI/README.md)<br>
    Confirm whether a signal is TRUE or FALSE by comparing price (RSI) with volume (MFI).

2. [EMA Crossovers Strategy](CROSSOVER-EMAs/README.md)<br>
    This strategy automatically buys and sells based on the crossover of two lines: a fast EMA (9 periods) and a slow EMA (21 periods).

3. [Bollinger Bands & EMA Crossovers](BOLLINGER-BANDS/README.md)<br>
    This indicator combines two technical analysis tools: EMAs to identify trends and Bollinger Bands to measure volatility and overbought/oversold levels.

4. [OBV & Bollinger Bands](OBV+BOLLINGER-BANDS/README.md)<br>
  This indicator analyzes trading volume to confirm the strength of price trends. It combines OBV (On Balance Volume) with Bollinger Bands and a fast EMA.

5. [MACD Impulse](MACD-IMPULSE/README.md)<br>
    This indicator measures the strength of price momentum in a smoother and less noisy way than traditional MACD. It uses special moving averages to filter out market noise.
