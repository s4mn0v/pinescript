# RSI + MFI Combined

**What you achieve:** Confirm whether a signal is REAL or FALSE by comparing price (RSI) with volume (MFI).

## The 4 Situations

### 1. Both Overbought (RSI >70 + MFI >80)

**Meaning:** High price WITH a lot of money coming in **Action:** STRONG SIGNAL of a top. High risk of correction. **Example:** BTC at $50k, RSI 75, MFI 85 = everyone bought, possible drop coming soon

### 2. Both Oversold (RSI <30 + MFI <20)

**Meaning:** Low price WITH a lot of money flowing out **Action:** STRONG SIGNAL of bottom. Possible rebound. **Example:** BTC at $38k, RSI 25, MFI 18 = mass panic, buying opportunity

### 3. RSI Overbought but MFI Normal (RSI >70 + MFI 40-60)

**Meaning:** Price rose WITHOUT volume support **Action:** Weak rise, likely FALSE. Do not buy. **Example:** BTC rises 8% but without real volume = bull trap

### 4. RSI Oversold but MFI Normal (RSI <30 + MFI 40-60)

**Meaning:** Price fell WITHOUT real selling conviction **Action:** Weak decline, likely quick rebound. **Example:** BTC falls 7% due to liquidations but without massive selling = recovery soon

## Divergences (Premium Signal)

**Bullish Divergence:**

- RSI makes higher low
- MFI makes higher low
- Price makes lower low = Buy early, bullish reversal likely

**Bearish Divergence:**

- RSI makes lower high
- MFI makes lower high
- Price makes higher high = Sell early, bearish reversal likely

## Practical Strategy

**Buy only when:** RSI <30 AND MFI <20 = Both confirm oversold with volume

**Sell only when:** RSI >70 AND MFI >80 = Both confirm overbought with volume

**Ignore when:** RSI and MFI do not match = Unreliable signal, wait for confirmation
